Assalamu-alaikum Didi

I am writing this to give a clarity regarding everything and I wanted you to know the whole picture.
Please do not tell Ammi anything about this. 

Its regarding the situation with Shahedah and why things are the way they are.

As you know, Shahedah felt lots of stress and we consulted a psychiatrist and also a psychologist (therapist). She is thus now diagnosed with clincial depression. According to the doctors analysis, she has something called as the [adjustment disorder](https://shatayumulticlinic.com/disease/adjustment-disorder/). This happened due to many changes she faced post our marriage, be it lifestyle changes, stress at work, weather, family conflicts/arguments, habits, day to day lives, language, work culture differences etc., For her many things have changed drastically and while adjusting to it, she has taken a lot of stress.

Anyway, the current situation is that she is recovering. We are doing multiple things to keep her occupied and have a healthy lifestyle. We are both going to join GYMs - we found a women fitness centre and Shahedah likes it. She will join there. To cope with boredom and hopelessness, she is inculcating a few habits like painting again, we bought plants and she is taking care of them, she is trying to make changes to the house as a hobby - you might have seen these, flower pots, decorations in hall and she also put her paintings in our room. All these are mechanisms for her to not feel lost and hopless. Even related to work, she sees her other colleagues are having a better career as they chose clincial and her career does not seem so bright as pathology is very hectic subject and the end product is not so great. Her career might be mediocre. She worries about that too. Also our healths have deteriorated a lot. We had bad eating habits and it resulted in both of our weight gains. That too we are starting to fix by eating healthy and cooking ourselves with as less oil as possible and as nutritous as possible. We are starting many such things for her keep her occupied.

She is still finding it hard to resume work at Osmania. After returning from Mumbai recently, she went to Osmania but is finding it very stressful as her state is not great yet. Recently she has asked for leave again, to get herself better and concentrate on studying ( its 3rd year so there will be a final PG degree exam ) and also maintain the healthy habits to get her mental state better. They have reluctantly accepted it and thus she is studying from home currently and if any exams or need to go then she is going. This does not mean full leave, as once PG exams ends, she anyway has to work again at Osmania for all the days she took leaves. So its just temporary leave for her to get better mentally.

And regarding she being such when you come is because she feels that the environment she wants to live in has changed. Because when you come there are quite a few drastic changes at home including the change in daily food, state of house etc., What affects her is that she feels uncomfortable and feels that her privacy and autonomy are affected. She does not have a problem with you coming but is affected when your stay is long. She keeps her things, surroundings, bag, room, house very neat and organised. She gives this very high importance and its just not a habit, its a personality. I have tried over the years to make her understand but its hard for her to oversee. It does not mean she keeps the house extremely clean but likes keeping things organized and gives utmost importance to it. And now with her mental state in such condition, this has become a bigger concern for her.

The things she feels uncomfortable and bothered and affected about are small for us and you and me would easily oversee but for her these value a lot and its just not an excuse, I see her all day everyday and most of her free time she spends on keeping things clean, organizing and everything to be streamlined and processed, its almost like an OCD. something like below. not too much but close to it.

<img width="346" alt="image" src="https://github.com/wildsemicolon/text/assets/79313570/bae90506-68a5-4e14-974c-80531075b37e" />

and when this is affected, she feels violated and takes a lot of stress. And this we have since our marriage too, even in Nampally and Peddapally. And I have also seen, she behaves the same in her own house in Mumbai too and gets very frustrated and furious when things go wrong in this matter. And we have seen there have been quite a few arguments between Ammi and her regarding this. I have always tried to make her understand that, this is of not much importance and even she has tried to oversee but it does not persist. I understand that you and Ammi say that if Ammi is cooking then Shahedah could clean to help her, but it would make her feel wrong. She would cook and clean herself. Like even now and when Ammi, Pappa came during Eid she has cooked and cleaned herself.

This dynamic gets affected when you stay for long. I obviously as your brother completely understand and all of these things do not affect me but it does affect her and I do not know what to do. I feel helpless at times. I obviously understand your need to stay for long and I obviously care for you and kids but when I see that this is affecting her so much, I do not know what to do. All the previous times, I have argued, fought for many days, and what not about this but she feels and argues that she is right by the textbook ( as in she is not wrong in what she is asking for ) and even I try to make her understand it leaves with only one option in the end - to tell her outright that "this is how it is going to be" and "you have to accept it". which I have actually a few times directly and indirectly and in such cases she goes into denial - You remember when she stayed in the room at Nampally for a month or so - where I used to order her food when you were pregnant. The same things were affecting her then.

She is severly affected by things like
- disorganised and uncleaned kitchen including stove and surroundings
- disorganised and uncleaned dining table
- disorganised and uncleaned house and things around rooms
- food items and kachra scattered around house ( she says when I walk out I stamp on sticky items like rice or something and asks me - if she is wrong to expect that the house be neat when she gives it so much importance )
- dirty clothes / diapers / wet clothes due to urine of kids being scattered around house
- she has found balls of hair at places around the house and she showed me

and many such things. Many small things for us but big things for her.

I understand the dynamics that exist when you all, Ammi log and me and Shahedah stay here. Shahedah goes to hospital, I work and try to involve in the house a little, Pappa does a little but mostly Ammi takes care of everything and obviously she is old and weak and it takes a toll on her and she would cook in the fastest way possible and its wrong to expect her to keep things neat like Shahedah does and the same thing I told Shahedah - but she says "Am I the one to blame for this? Is it so wrong of me to expect that the house I live in as a wife stays like I want to. I expect the minimum". On those lines, she argues. I do keep arguing with her but as usual, it goes no where.

again she has no right to say that you should not come here and honestly she too isn't actually a bad person to want such. and you are my sister and I would never let it come to that but what she wants is that the quality and quantity of your stay here does not affect her. 

I obviously understand that Ammi says that its everybody's house and as how daughters visit nanial's for summer and other holidays, it should not affect her. But you know how current generation people are. She feels she has equal right in this house - she takes extra steps to take care of the house and its not possible for me to tell her that - no, you should work on this house to make it better - but you have no say in its functionings.

What she expects and what according to me would not affect her is that your stay is defined and limited. As in you obviously should come here, its where your brother stays and your mother and father will stay but she wants it to be limited - I do not know how to measure the quantity but say when its no holiday season then you come a weekend in a month or so and go back and when its holidays - say you stay for a week or so - like now and then go back. Thats what she expects. And to cater for Mahira log, she expects you to call Ammi log to your place like how you have now recently. If you call Ammi log to your place when you need their help in taking care of kids, she will feel that as fair and she would also get privacy and autonomy from time to time when Ammi log go to your place at such times. For her, it would solve her stress of your stay troubling her and also it would provide her some alone time. And when you stay here, you keep the house neat and organized like how she leaves it. I know It feels unorthodox but this is what she expects and what would be ideal going forward because if not then I dont think she would be alright with the same things going forward.

She would go back into the cocoon like how she did in Nampally during your pregnancy or I do not know she will stay in the room and stress and not come out at all like she does. And I would be obliged to probably let her go to Mumbai like she did last summer for a month or so because if not she would stay in the room and stress and vent and with her mental state, I do not want to deal with all this and risk anything so I will send her.

Moreover, currently there are water issues here now. We are getting the bore water once in the morning and then once in the evening. Rest of the time, there is no water in any tap except in one tap in kitchen that is kinda like backup bore water the watchman is putting. Past 2 days, even that one tap's water stopped. The borewell is dry and will stay such for a month or so till the summer passes. 

She is planning to go to Mumbai in June. The psychiatrist and therapist's consultations are ending and we need to go for further medicines anyway. Currently she has informed for leave and extension at the hospital and not planning to go any soon ( I did not tell Ammi log about this yet. Do not tell yet ) because she has tried to go and went a few times after she has been back from Mumbai but she has had so much anxiety and felt depressed. Her physical health is very bad too, she has gained a lot of weight, so much hair loss, skin issues, pimples, stretch marks what not and all this keep affecting her mental health and the loop continues. So her mental health needs to set right first along with her physical health only then she can continue her PG. I am thinking 2-3 months from now she would be able to. Thats why from Monday she is joining fitness class and will study everyday, paint, maintain house etc., everything that helps her mental health and brings her back to normalcy. And because of this timing and her current state is the reason - I am telling you all this.

Currently, with all this. Please do not get me wrong. I had to tell you all this, because previously I did not tell you anything, ever since the beginning. I do not want to go into the future and feel, I should I have told clearly everything to everyone

This does not mean you should not come. I wish I could explain more clearly but this is what I have right now.

**I will explain more clearly when possible. Currently it's hard to privately talk to you. Hopefully you do not misunderstand me. I have utmost love and care for you and kids and Jeeju. I would never harm our relationship like Ammi is fearing of. But I have to tell you all this - now or at some point. so telling now.**

Ab bhi, you should come but she expects you like I mentioned before.

I feel helpless here and thats why I have told you the whole story.
